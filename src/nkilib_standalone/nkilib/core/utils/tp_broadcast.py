    Transposes then broadcasts src[0:1, :] onto all partitions of dst
    Using a single transpose instruction (on PE) and repeated input access to broadcast src to dst
    Each partition of dst will become a transposed version of src.

    WARNING: This function will always broadcast src[0:1], it will throw error if
    a slice is passed in.

    All inputs and outputs to this function are assumed to be in sbuf.
    This requires 2D src [P, 1] and dst [broad_cast_dim, P]
    where the first dim of src must match the second dim of dst.
    Uses a psum bank for the transpose

    Args:
        src: 2D input tensor. Shape: [P, F]
        dst: 2D output tensor. Shape: [B, P]
        src_offset: Specify the offset in F to take the column from
