    compile_and_infer: marks tests to compile and run inference on hardware
    simulation: marks tests to run in CPU simulation mode
    fast: marks test as fast-running using manual test vectors only
    slow_simulation: marks test as slow for CPU simulation (large tensor shapes)
    coverage_parametrize: test parametrization with configurable coverage strategies (singles/pairs/full) and constraint filtering
    platforms(exclude): Mark test with unsupported platforms to skip when --platform-target matches an excluded platform
